Nahaıwa is a prototype of a constructed monosemic language, i.e. a loglang: syntactic ambiguities are disallowed, as well as word polysemy and homonymy not resolvable through syntax alone, as well as opaque idiomatic expressions not explicitly marked as such. It is also an artlang, inasmuch as aesthetics (in the eyes of the author) is taken into account.
