# Lexicon

Nahaıwa's lexicon can be found **[here](https://github.com/Ntsekees/Nahaiwa/blob/main/lexicon.tsv)** (TSV format) and **[here](https://ntsekees.github.io/Nahaiwa/lexicon.html)** (HTML format).

For roots, participant slots are represented by numbered black circles, ordered according to the following case hierarchy:  
* For unary roots: Intransitive case;
* For binary verbs: Ergative → Accusative;
* For ternary verbs: Pegative → Dative → Missive.

## Lexicosemantics

The lexicon of Nahaıwa purposefully lacks lexical polysemy, specifically the kind in which a same sound form has a prefined set of discrete, contextually-selected possible meanings that cannot all be simultaneously selected, such as the English “bat”, which can mean a wooden stick, or a flying mammal, but cannot mean both at once: in the sentence “there are two bats in the room”, one would not assume a reading where there's one wooden stick and one flying mammal.
This is to be contrasted with words which have a single broad meaning, such as “animal” (which covers mammals, birds, reptiles, insects, snails, worms…), and words with disjunctive meanings (i.e. which can be defined using the logical disjunction “or”, yielding a discontinuous semantic space).

Semantic broadness (as with “animal”) is not a form of polysemy, and is both desirable, useful and absolutely necessary for any functional general purpose language. A word like “animal”, when put to the aforementioned test of polysemy, yield a valid statement: “there are two animals in the room” is acceptable to say when there's exactly one flying mammal and one reptile in the room, a result unlike that with the polysemous word “bat”. A semantically broad word like “animal” can be part of Nahaıwa's lexicon, but a polysemous word like “bat” cannot.
