## Dislocated Predicate

The Dislocated Predicate (DP) Role ⟪hı-⟫ is used for displacing a verb stem away from its normal position at the start of the clause, position that must then be occupied by a dummy substitute root, devoid of meaning but nonetheless announcing the valency of the forthcoming dislocated verb. The predicate substitute roots are ⟪-wáʼ⟫ (monovalent), ⟪-ráʼ⟫ (bivalent) and ⟪-káoʼ⟫ (trivalent). The actual predicate of the clause can then be placed anywhere within the same clausal level, and is marked with the Dislocated Predicate Role, as examplified below:

```  
┌───────────────  
│ ◆ Aıráʼ cacʰatʼí hınucál. 
│ ❖ ASR-DUMMY  NTR-NTR-DEF:NTR-bird  DP-ERG-1:ACC-see_stimulus  
│ ➥ The bird sees me. 
└─  
```
Which means exactly the same as ⟪Aınucal cacʰatʼí⟫. 

## Echo-Resumptive
The Echo-Resumptive ⟪θı-⟫ prefixes a word base that is a repetition of a base which already occurred in the head of a clause, and it indicates a return to that clause level, specifically the closest clause level headed with this root if there are several ones, with the result that any following complement belongs to that clause level.

## Afterthought Relativizer  
The Afterthought Relativizer is a special Role that terminates the current clause (even if it is the root clause), binds the proposition described by the clause to the Pendent pronoun, then turn the clause into a pendent-like expression hanging at the beginning of a new clause, whose main verb is the contentive bearing the Afterthought Relativizer Role.  
  
```  
  ┌───────────────  
  │ ◆ Aılé tacʰatʼí, ʎaıθenïtoyi̋čal.  
  │ ❖ ASR-√is_blue  NTR-NTR-DEF:NTR-√bird  
  │   ATR-you_know_what:PEG-me:DAT-RSM:MIS-√assert_to  
  │ ➥ The bird was blue, they said to me.  
  └─  
```  
  
If the Afterthought Relativizer is used on the root clause whose root verb bears non-null Evidentiality, then the scope of the Evidentiality remains that of the clause terminated by the Afterthought Relativizer, as opposed of scoping over the whole sentence. The relation between the Evidentiality and the terminated clause is incidental, non-restrictive.  
  
```  
  ┌───────────────  
  │ ◆ Olé tacʰatʼí, ʎaıθenïtoyi̋čal.  
  │ ❖ ASR.RPT-√is_blue  NTR-NTR-DEF:NTR-√bird  
  │   ATR-you_know_what:PEG-me:DAT-RSM:MIS-√assert_to  
  │ ➥ I heard that the bird was blue, that's what they said to me (at least).  
  └─  
```  

## Coordinative and Conjunctionizers

The ERG-NOM and NOM-ERG conjunctionizers can only be applied to binary roots expressing a relation between two propositions, such as logical connective predicates like ⟪-áı⟫, "and". They convert the binary predicate into an afterthought, interposed conjunction, a conjunction placed between the two connectands it governs.  
In the case of the ERG-NOM version, the first connectand goes into the ERG slot and the second one in the NOM slot; with the NOM-ERG conjunctionizer, it's the other way around. The difference is insignificant if the binary relation is reflexive, i.e. reciprocal.  
The propositional versions take two propositions as their arguments; the eventive versions take as arguments events instantiating the propositions, i.e. the physical manifestation of these abstract propositions.  
When two noun phrases are conjoined with a conjunction, the two must bear the same noun case. When two verbs in the same clause are conjoined, the second one bears the Coordinative Role ⟪hu-⟫.  
A bare Coordinative Role, not preceded by a conjunction word, is a shorthand for a logical AND conjoining two verbs, i.e. with the ⟪ñaʼáı⟫ conjunction left out implicit.  
  
```  
  ┌───────────────  
  │ ◆ Ici̋ tacʰakóyu ñaʼáı tacʰaƛúrı.  
  │ ❖ ASR.SEN-√is_one  NTR-NTR-DEF:NTR-√dog  EAPCZ-√and  
  │   NTR-NTR-DEF:NTR-√cat  
  │ ➥ Both the dog and the cat are one/single.  
  └─  
```  
```  
  ┌───────────────  
  │ ◆ Ici̋ tacʰakóyu (ñaʼáı) hurú tacʰaƛúrı.  
  │ ❖ ASR.SEN-√is_one  NTR-NTR-DEF:NTR-√dog  (EAPCZ-√and)  
  │   COO-√are_two NTR-NTR-DEF:NTR-√cat  
  │ ➥ The dog is one, and the cats are two.  
  └─  
```  
```  
  ┌───────────────  
  │ ◆ Oθenïyi̋čal qaoci̋ tacʰakóyu (ñaʼáı) hurú tacʰaƛúrı.  
  │ ❖ ASR.REC-you_know_what:ERG₃-me:DAT-√assert_to  
  │   ACC₃-PCCS-√is_one  NTR-NTR-DEF:NTR-√dog  (EAPCZ-√and)  
  │   COO-√are_two NTR-NTR-DEF:NTR-√cat  
  │ ➥ That one said to me that the dog was one and the cats were two.  
  └─  
```  
  
## Quantifierizers
The two binary quantifierizers function in an homologuous manner to the conjunctionizers, but instead of constructing conjunctions, they do binary quantifiers instead. A binary quantifier is a word that is placed immediately before a noun (with normal noun case inflection), and it defines the relation between the unary property used to define the noun and the unary property defined by the slot of the verb which the noun goes into. Whereas conjunctionizers operate on binary predicates relating two propositions, quantifierizers operate on binary predicates relating two unary properties. Such "quantificational binary predicates" may be examplified by the predicates ⟪[ERG] is a property that is universal among what has property [ACC]⟫ (root ⟪-kú⟫), corresponding to the quantifier "all", "every", in the English language. In the sentence "all cats are mammals" can be reworded as "the property of being a mammal is universal among what has the property of being a cat", "mammalhood is universal among what have cathood".  
  The Universal Determinacy ⟪-ıw-⟫ and the Existential Determinacy ⟪-uy-⟫ may be regarded as shorthands for a quantifierizer expression.
