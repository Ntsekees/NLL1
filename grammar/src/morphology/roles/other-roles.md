• The ERG-NOM and NOM-ERG conjunctionizers can only be applied to binary roots expressing a relation between two propositions, such as logical connective predicates like ⟪-áı⟫, "and". They convert the binary predicate into an afterthought, interposed conjunction, a conjunction placed between the two connectands it governs.  
  In the case of the ERG-NOM version, the first connectand goes into the ERG slot and the second one in the NOM slot; with the NOM-ERG conjunctionizer, it's the other way around. The difference is insignificant if the binary relation is reflexive, i.e. reciprocal.  
  The propositional versions take two propositions as their arguments; the eventive versions take as arguments events instantiating the propositions, i.e. the physical manifestation of these abstract propositions.  
  When two noun phrases are conjoined with a conjunction, the two must bear the same noun case. When two verbs in the same clause are conjoined, the second one bears the Coordinative Role ⟪hu-⟫.  
  A bare Coordinative Role, not preceded by a conjunction word, is a shorthand for a logical AND conjoining two verbs, i.e. with the ⟪ñaʼáı⟫ conjunction left out implicit.

• The two binary quantifierizers function in an homologuous manner to the conjunctionizers, but instead of constructing conjunctions, they do binary quantifiers instead. A binary quantifier is a word that is placed immediately before a noun (with normal noun case inflection), and it defines the relation between the unary property used to define the noun and the unary property defined by the slot of the verb which the noun goes into. Whereas conjunctionizers operate on binary predicates relating two propositions, quantifierizers operate on binary predicates relating two unary properties. Such "quantificational binary predicates" may be examplified by the predicates ⟪➊ is a property that is universal among what has property ➋⟫ (root ⟪-kú⟫), corresponding to the quantifier "all", "every", in the English language. In the sentence "all cats are mammals" can be reworded as "the property of being a mammal is universal among what has the property of being a cat", "mammalhood is universal among what have cathood".  
  The Universal Determinacy ⟪-ıw-⟫ and the Existential Determinacy ⟪-uy-⟫ may be regarded as shorthands for a quantifierizer expression.  
  
• The Afterthought Relativizer is a special Role that terminates the current clause (even if it is the root clause), binds the proposition described by the clause to the Pendent pronoun, then turn the clause into a pendent-like expression hanging at the beginning of a new clause, whose main verb is the contentive bearing the Afterthought Relativizer Role.

  │   ATR-you_know_what:TC1-me:TC2-RSM:TC3-√assert_to  
  │ ➥ The bird was blue, they said to me.  
  └─  
```  
  
If the Afterthought Relativizer is used on the root clause whose root verb bears non-null Evidentiality, then the scope of the Evidentiality remains that of the clause terminated by the Afterthought Relativizer, as opposed of scoping over the whole sentence. The relation between the Evidentiality and the terminated clause is incidental, non-restrictive.
