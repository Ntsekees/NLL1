◉ The **Elucidative Focus** ⟪-aw-⟫ serves the purpose of indicating the part of a clause that expresses new information, the part that answers an interrogation of the audience, be it an explicit question, of an implicit, assumed one. In English, this function can be expressed either with an emphatic intonation on the focused word, or by using a syntactic cleft of the form ⟪it is [focus] which/who ……⟫, for example, ⟪it was me who took it⟫, which may be a suitable answer to the question ⟪who took it?⟫.  
When a clause does not contain an Elucidative Focus, the clause's verb plays the role of indicating the most salient new information.

◉ The **Presuppositional Marker**, or **Background Marker**, ⟪-ay-⟫, indicates elements that are presupposed to exist, or presupposed to be true in the sentence. Presuppositions stand out more in non-assertive sentences, such as interrogative sentences:
