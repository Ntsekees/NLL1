# Other case-like roles

These Role prefixes (Slot 2a) behave much like noun cases, although the syntactic roles they govern aren't nominal; like noun cases, they are accompanied by an Inner Case vocalic affix, and an optional Determinacy affix.

┌───────────────────┬─────┐  
│ Interjective      │  y  │  
│ Vocative          │  w  │

└───────────────────┴─────┘

• The Interjective Case turns a contentive word into an interjection, meaning that the speaker is satisfying the selected case role of the predicate at the present moment.  
  
```  
  ┌───────────────  
  │ ◆ Yıƛʼé.  
  │ ❖ ITJ-ERG-feel_pain  
  │ ➥ Ouch!  
  └─  
```  
  
• The Vocative Case indicates the identity of the intended recipient of the utterance, the addressee.  
  
```  
  ┌───────────────  
  │ ◆ Waqaséʼ mıkıtʼušatʰıwá.  
  │ ❖ VOC-INTR-the_one_named_after_property:INTR-cloud  
  │   PQ-you:ERG-lambda_1:NOM-ongoing-is_intentionally:ERG-has_property  
  │ ➥ Cloud, what are you doing?  
  └─  
```  
  
• The Plural Union Case has a special syntax: instead of complementing the clause's verb, it links together the marked noun and the immediately preceding one, merging them into a single new noun whose referents are the union of the referents of the two target nouns; this corresponds to certain usages of the word ⟪and⟫ and the expression ⟪together with⟫ in English.  
  The two following example sentences illustrate the difference between the ‘logical AND’ and the plural union:  
    
```  
  ┌───────────────  
  │ ◆ Ici̋ tayakóyu ñaʼáı tayaƛúrı ne.  
  │ ❖ ASR.SEN-√is_one  INTR-DEF-INTR-√dog  CZ2-√and  
  │   INTR-DEF-INTR-√cat  EOT  
  │ ➥ Both the dog and the cat are one/single. [EOT]  
  └─  
```  
```  
  ┌───────────────  
  │ ◆ Irú tayakóyu nayaƛúrı ne.  
  │ ❖ ASR.SEN-√are_two  INTR-DEF-INTR-√dog  
  │   PU-DEF-INTR-√cat  EOT  
  │ ➥ The dog together with the cat are two. [EOT]  
  └─  
```  
  
• The Sequential Case is used to construct sequences, lists, and is applied to all non-initial members of the list. The first member's case indicates the syntactic role of the whole list.  
  
• The Adjectival Case turns the contentive word into a restrictive adjective modifying the immediately preceding contentive, no matter its syntactic role (even non-nominal roles). The resulting meaning corresponds to that of a ‘logical AND’ conjunction.  
  
```  
  ┌───────────────  
  │ ◆ Unınθıcál kacatʼí lalé.  
  │ ❖ REC-me:ERG-associative_plural:ERG-see_stimulus  
  │   NOM-INTR-one_in_number:INTR-bird ADJ-INTR-blue  
  │ ➥ We saw a blue bird. (Something that is blue and is a bird.)  
  └─  
```  
  
• The Propositional Case turns the contentive word into a restrictive subordinating clausal adverb, i.e. an adverb that modifies the whole proposition represented by the current clause, and not describing the physical spatiotemporal manifestation (event) of that proposition: it would be suitable for expressing the adverbs "probably", "arguably", "frequently", but not event-specific adverbs such as "beautifully", for which the Eventive Case would be appropriate.
