# Other case-like roles

These Role prefixes (Slot 2a) behave much like noun cases, although the syntactic roles they govern aren't nominal; like noun cases, they are accompanied by an Inner Case vocalic affix, and an optional Determinacy affix.  

## Adjunct roles

```  
┌─────────────────────┬─────┐  
│ Interjective        │  y  │  
│ Plural union        │  n  │  
│ Sequential          │  ŋ  │  
│ Attributive         │  l  │  
└─────────────────────┴─────┘  
```  
  
• The Interjective Case turns a contentive word into an interjection, meaning that the speaker is satisfying the selected case role of the predicate at the present moment.  
  
```  
  ┌───────────────  
  │ ◆ Yıƛʼé.  
  │ ❖ ITJ-ERGᵢ-feel_pain  
  │ ➥ Ouch!  
  └─  
```  
  
• The Plural Union Case has a special syntax: instead of complementing the clause's verb, it links together the marked noun and the immediately preceding one, merging them into a single new noun whose referents are the union of the referents of the two target nouns; this corresponds to certain usages of the word ⟪and⟫ and the expression ⟪together with⟫ in English.  
  The two following example sentences illustrate the difference between the ‘logical AND’ and the plural union:  
    
```  
  ┌───────────────  
  │ ◆ Ici̋ tacʰakóyu ñaʼáı tacʰaƛúrı ne.  
  │ ❖ ASR.SEN꞊√is_one  NTR-NTRᵢ-DEF:NTR-√dog  DPCZ-√and  
  │   NTR-NTRᵢ-DEF:NTR-√cat  EOT  
  │ ➥ Both the dog and the cat are one/single. [EOT]  
  └─  
```  
```  
  ┌───────────────  
  │ ◆ Irú tacʰakóyu nacʰaƛúrı ne.  
  │ ❖ ASR.SEN꞊√are_two  NTR-NTRᵢ-DEF:NTR-√dog  
  │   PU-NTRᵢ-DEF:NTR-√cat  EOT  
  │ ➥ The dog together with the cat are two. [EOT]  
  └─  
```  
  
• The Sequential Case is a special case exclusively used for listing nouns that make up a plural reference or a sequence/list, as initiated by a special prefix such as ⟪-ʎp-⟫ (plural union initiator) or ⟪-pš-⟫ (sequence initiator). This case is applied to all non-initial members of the list; the first member's case indicates the syntactic role of the whole list.  


```
┌───────────────
│ ◆ Aŋkaʎpanayá ŋakayá.
│   A꞊ŋka-{ʎp-[a-na-yá] ŋ-[a-ka-yá]}.
│ ❖ ASR.NFR꞊12:NTR-PUI-NTR-1:NTR-thing SEQ-NTR-2:NTR-thing
│ ➥ We are me together with you.
└─
```

• The Attributive Case turns the contentive word into a restrictive modifier targeting an immediately preceding contentive bearing an Inner Case slot `2c`, be it a noun, an adverb or another adjective. The contentive bearing the Attributive Case express an additional property of the referent of the preceding contentive, as selected by the Inner Case of that preceding contentive. The two words (the adjective and the word it modifies) are semantically conjoined by a ‘logical AND’ conjunction, i.e. the two words express two different properties or descriptions of their common referents.  
  
```  
  ┌───────────────  
  │ ◆ Unınθıcál kacatʼí lalé.  
  │ ❖ REC꞊1:ERG-ASO:ERG-see_stimulus  
  │   NOM-NTRᵢ-one_in_number:NTR-bird ATR-NTRᵢ-blue  
  │ ➥ We saw a blue bird. (Something that is blue and is a bird.)  
  └─  
```  
  

## Discourse-level Roles

```  
┌─────────────────────┬─────┐  
│ Vocative            │  w  │  
│ Topical             │  r  │  
│ Discourse Situative │  qʰ │  
└─────────────────────┴─────┘  
```  

• The Vocative Case indicates the identity of the intended recipient of the utterance, the addressee.  
  
```  
  ┌───────────────  
  │ ◆ Waqaséʼ, mıkıtʼušatʰıwá.  
  │ ❖ VOC-NTRᵢ-the_one_named_after_property:NTR-cloud  
  │   P꞊2:ERG-NTR_LAM:NTR-PROG-is_intentionally:ERG-has_property  
  │ ➥ Cloud, what are you doing?  
  └─  
```  

• The Topical Case, or Discourse Pendent Case, marks the topic of the following sentence.  

• The Discourse Situative sets the frame or context in which the following discourse is true. It is the discourse-level equivalent of the Situative Case.
