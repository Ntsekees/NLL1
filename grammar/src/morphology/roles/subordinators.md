# Subordinators

  
Subordinator values (slot 2c):  
```  
┌──────────────────────────┬─────┐  
│ Relative clause          │ eo  │  
│ Plain content clause     │ ao  │  
│ Polarity clause          │ ea  │  
│ Unary template clause #1 │ oı  │  
│ Unary template clause #2 │ ██  │  
│ Binary Template Clause   │ oa  │  
│ Ternary Template Clause  │ ıʼı │  
└──────────────────────────┴─────┘  
```  
  
These morphemes occupy the same slot as Inner Cases (slot 2c), but are not true Cases. They turn the words which bear them into ‘participles’, words that have the special syntactic effect of opening a whole subordinate clause (which may be exited for returning to the outer clause by using an appropriate Binding proclitic; see the section [Binding Slot](../binding-slot.md)). The participle can assume any syntactic roles which normal contentives can assume via outer case inflection: a participle bearing a noun case will be a “noun participle” (i.e. a verbal noun), with an adverbial case it will be an “adverbial participle”, and so on. Even if all these morphemes cause the opening of a subordinate clause, they differ in what kind of clause is created.  
In addition to occurring in slot 2c, Subordinators may also occur as extensional prefixes, with a glottal stop ⟪ʼ⟫ prefixed to their vocalic form (for example, ⟪-ʼao-⟫ for the plain content clause subordinator).  
  
Relative clauses are clauses that refer to one of the participants (called the ‘antecedant’) mentioned within the clause and represented by the ‘resumptive pronoun’ (whose whose extensional form is ⟪-t◈-⟫); the relative clause describes its antecedent, and the whole relative clause's referent is the antecedent itself.  
  
Content clauses, on the other hand, do not involve any resumptive pronoun, and the referent of a content clause is the abstract proposition described by the clause.  
  
Template clauses are similar to content clauses but contain ‘blanks’, parts that have been abstracted away, similarly to blanks in a form, ready to be filled in. A template clause defines a predicate, and each ‘blank’ corresponds to one of the argument slots of the predicate.  
Each such blank or slot is represented by a so-called ‘lambda pronoun’ (named after lambda calculus).  
There is one vocalic morpheme for each predicate arity, and each arity has its own set of lambda pronouns. Additionally, there are two different morphemes for unary predicates, they only differ in having a different lambda pronoun.  
  
```  
┌─────────────────────────┬─────┬─────────────────────────────────┐  
│ Function                │ V   │ Lambda pronoun set              │  
├─────────────────────────┼─────┼──────────────────┬──────────────┤  
│ Unary Template Clause 1 │ oı  │ -tʼá             │ -tʼ◈-        │  
│ Unary Template Clause 2 │ ea  │ -ltʼá            │ -ltʼ◈-       │  
│ Binary Template Clause  │ oa  │ -cʼí, -kʼú       │ -cʼ◈-, -kʼ◈- │  
│ Ternary Template Clause │ ıʼı │ -pʼé, -čʼı̋, -qʼó │              │  
└─────────────────────────┴─────┴──────────────────┴──────────────┘  
```  
  
The lambda pronouns are shown in their contentive root form, with equivalent extensional prefix forms in the right-hand square (with ⟪◈⟫ standing for an Inner Case vocalic affix); only the unary and binary templates have extensional prefix forms for their lambda pronouns, as they are the most frequent in usage.  
It is noteworthy that the consonant of the lambda pronouns is the same as that of corresponding outer case's consonantal morpheme, and the vowel is likewise the same as the vowel of the corresponding inner case.
