These morphemes occupy the same slot as Inner Cases (slot 2c), but are not true Cases. They turn the words which bear them into *subordinated verbs*, words that have the special syntactic effect of opening a whole subordinate clause (which may be exited for returning to the outer clause by using an appropriate Anchoring proclitic; see the section [Anchoring Slot](../anchoring-slot.md)).

A clause is a syntactic structure made of a verb possibly accompanied by one or several complements, be them core argument complements, or circumstantial adjuncts (e.g. indication of time, place, manner, cause…). All sentences contain at least one clause, the root clause, hosting the root verb, which is the only finite verb in Nahaıwa. A sentence may optionally contain subordinate clauses, potentially nested into one another; subordinate clauses may assume a variety of different functions, they may act as nominal arguments for verbs (as in the English *⟪I know that [you know]⟫*), or as attributives attaching to a noun (*⟪I saw the man [whom you saw]⟫*), or as adverbials adding circumstantial information (*⟪I stayed home because [it rained all day]⟫*).

In Nahaıwa, the subordinate verbs are a hybrid part of speech: from the point of view of the interior of the subordinate clause they open, they act like normal verbs; but from the point of view of the outside of the subclause, they can assume any function a normal contentive word can assume, depending on the role/case consonantal inflection which they bear.

Even if all the different morphemes shown in the table above cause the opening of a subordinate clause, they differ in what kind of clause is created. The different types are detailed one by one in the following sections.
 
In addition to occurring in slot 2c, Subordinators may also occur as extensional prefixes, with a glottal stop ⟪**ʼ**⟫ prefixed to their vocalic form (for example, ⟪**-ʼao-**⟫ for the plain content clause subordinator).  

## Relative clauses

Relative clauses are clauses that refer to one of the participants (called the ‘antecedant’) mentioned within the clause and represented by the *‘resumptive pronoun’* (`RSM` in glosses), whose whose extensional form is ⟪-t◈-⟫; the relative clause describes its antecedent, and the whole relative clause's referent is the antecedent itself.  
Nahaıwa ‘nouns’, such as ⟪**takóyu**⟫ “a dog”, can be regarded as actually be reduced relative clauses, where the inner case affix (here ⟪**-a-**⟫) acts as a vestigial relative pronoun inflecting for case. All such ‘nouns’ can be expanded to full-fledged relative clauses using the subordinator ⟪**-aı-**⟫, and a resumtive pronominal bearing the same case vowel as the original noun's inner case:
* ⟪**takóyu**⟫ ↦ ⟪**taıtakóyu**⟫  
  `t-aı-ta-kóyu`  
  `NTR-REL-RSM:NTR-is_dog`  
  *One which (it) is a dog.*
* ⟪**tıñú**⟫ ↦ ⟪**taıtıñú**⟫  
  `t-aı-tı-ñú`  
  `NTR-REL-RSM:ERG-eat`  
  *One which (it) eats.*
* ⟪**tuñú**⟫ ↦ ⟪**taıtuñú**⟫  
  `t-aı-tu-ñú`  
  `NTR-REL-RSM:ERG-eat`  
  *One which (something) eats it; one which is eaten.*

However, unlike simple nouns, nominal relative clauses allow a greater complexity in the description of the referent, allowing a full clause, made of a verb and zero or more complements, to be used as the descriptor:

* **taıtuñú cacʰakóyu**  
  `t-  aı= [ tu-     ñú  c-  a-   cʰa-kóyu ]`  
  `NTR-REL=[ RSM:ACC-eat ERG-NTRᵢ-DEF-dog  ]`  
  *One which [the dog ate **it**].*
  
* **taıłı̋ł sakoŋqʼaqʰáƛʰï**  
  `t-  aı= [ łı̋ł s-  a-   to-     ŋqʼa-   qʰáƛʰï`  
  `NTR-REL=[ mud LOC-NTRᵢ-RSM:EXT-part_of-fur`  
  *One which [there's mud on **their** fur]; one with mud on their fur.*  
  
* **taınıtʰú kaokıtunčáwa**  
  `t-  aı= [ nı-   tʰú`  
  `NTR-REL=[ 1:ERG-deem_true`  
  `k-  ao=[  kı-   tu-     nčáwa       ] ]`  
  `ACC-DCS=[ 2:ERG-RSM:ACC-acquitained ] ]`  
  *One which [I expect that [you are acquitained with (**them**)]].*

Like simple nouns, the consonantal Outer Case or Role of relative clauses shows the role it plays as a whole within the outside clause:

* **Oθınepá kaıraontʰetupá caqaséwa.**  
  `o=      θı-     ne-   pá`  
  `ASR;RPT=EXO:ERG-1:DAT-say`  
  `k-  aı= rao-ncʰe-       tu-     pá`  
  `ACC-REL=RET-ERG_PRO:DAT-RSM:ACC-say`  
  `c-  a-   qa-                      séwa`  
  `ERG-NTRᵢ-named_after_property:NTR-flower`  
  *(I heard that) they said to me the same thing as Sewa (Flower) had said to them.*

For using a relative clause attributively, attaching it to an external noun, like relative clauses in English, the Attributive Role ⟪**l-**⟫ must be used instead of a core noun case consonant:

* **Unıʎú kacʰól laıkıneyı̋čal kaoθıtuyálı.**  
  `U=      nı-   ʎú  k-  a-   cʰól`  
  `ASR.REC=1:ERG-go  ACC-NTRᵢ-building`  
  `l-  aı= kı-   ne-   yı̋čal`  
  `ATR-REL=2:ERG-1:DAT-assert`  
  `k-  ao= θı-     tu-     yálı`  
  `ACC-DCS=EXO:ACC-RSM:ACC-inhabit`  
  *(I recall that) I went to the building which you told me that they inhabit.*


## Plain (declarative) content clauses

Content clauses, unlike relative clauses, do not involve any resumptive pronoun, and the referent of a content clause is the whole of its content, and not just one single element within it. Plain, declarative content clauses, opened by the subordinator ⟪**-ao-**⟫ (glossed `DCS`), represent the abstract proposition described by the clause, corresponding to the non-relative use of the ⟪that⟫ subordinator in English, as in the sentence ⟪I know that you know⟫.

* **Inıráyu kaoleršı̋.**  
  `ı=      nı-   ráyu  k-  ao= le- ršı̋ `  
  `ASR;SEN=1:ERG-wish  ACC-DCS=FUT-rain`  
  *I wish that it will rain.*

Another kind of content clause is the *‘polarity clause’*, opened by the subordinator ⟪**-ea-**⟫ (glossed `PCS`), corresponding to the English ⟪whether⟫, is used for embedded polar interrogative clauses:

* **Mıkıtʰú kealeršı̋ saháoye.**  
  `mı=kı-   tʰú       k-   ea= le- ršı̋`  
  `PQ=2:ERG-deem_true ACC-PCS=FUT-rain`  
  `s-  a-   háoye`
  `LOC-NTRᵢ-today`  
  *Do you know whether it will rain today?*


## Template clauses

Template clauses are similar to content clauses but contain ‘blanks’, parts that have been abstracted away, similarly to blanks in a form, ready to be filled in. A template clause defines a predicate, and each ‘blank’ corresponds to one of the argument slots of the predicate.  
Each such blank or slot is represented by a so-called ‘lambda pronoun’ (named after lambda calculus).  
There is one vocalic morpheme for each predicate arity, and each arity has its own set of lambda pronouns. Additionally, there are two different morphemes for unary predicates, they only differ in having a different lambda pronoun.  
Like other Nahaıwa pronominals, the lambda pronouns are extensional prefixes, with a variable vowel representing an Inner Case, represented as ⟪◈⟫ below:
  
```  
┌────────────────────────────┬─────┬────────────────────┐  
│ Function                   │ V   │ Lambda pronoun set │  
├────────────────────────────┼─────┼────────────────────┤  
│ Unary Template Clause      │ oı  │ tʼ◈                │  
│ Binary Template Clause     │ oa  │ cʼ◈, kʼ◈           │  
│ Ternary Template Clause    │ eʼe │ cʼ◈, pʼ◈, kʼ◈      │  
│ Quaternary Template Clause │ oʼo │ cʼ◈, pʼ◈, čʼ◈, kʼ◈ │  
└────────────────────────────┴─────┴────────────────────┘  
```  

It is noteworthy that the consonant of the lambda pronominals is the same as that of corresponding outer case's consonantal morpheme, and the vowel is likewise the same as the vowel of the corresponding inner case.

* **Inıkeyéwa koıtʼınepákı.**  
  `ı=      nı-   ke-   yéwa`  
  `ASR;SEN=1:ERG-2:DAT-grateful`  
  `k-  oı= tʼı-        ne-   pákı`  
  `ACC-UTC=NTR_LAM:ERG-1:DAT-help`  
  *I am grateful to you for having helped me.*

* **Aŋkıpθú koacʼıtʰú kaoθıkʼutwá.**  
  `a=      ŋkı-   pθú   `  
  `ASR;INF=12:ERG-differ`  
  `k-  oa= cʼı-        tʰú`  
  `ACC-BTC=ERG_LAM:ERG-deem_true`  
  `k-  ao= θı-     kʼu-        twá`  
  `ACC-DCS꞊EXO:ERG-ACC_LAM:ACC-intend`  
  *We (me+you) differ in what we think he intends to do.*
