# Determinacy

## Affixes

Determinacy affixes are optional and occur in slot 2b.
  
```  
┌────────────────────────────────────┬─────┐  
│ Elucidative focus                  │ aw  │  
│ Presupposition marker              │ ay  │ 
│ Abstract property                  │ oy  │  
│ Collective universal quantifier    │ ew  │  
│ Distributive universal quantifier  │ ıw  │  
│ Existential quantifier             │ uy  │  
│ Unary quantifierizer               │ ey  │  
└────────────────────────────────────┴─────┘  
```  

◉ The **Elucidative Focus** ⟪-aw-⟫ serves the purpose of indicating the part of a clause that expresses new information, the part that answers an interrogation of the audience, be it an explicit question, of an implicit, assumed one. In English, this function can be expressed either with an emphatic intonation on the focused word, or by using a syntactic cleft of the form ⟪it is [focus] which/who ……⟫, for example, ⟪it was me who took it⟫, which may be a suitable answer to the question ⟪who took it?⟫.  
When a clause does not contain an Elucidative Focus, the clause's verb plays the role of indicating the most salient new information.


```
┌───────────────
│ ◆ Iθutákı cawanayá.
│ ❖ ASR.SEN-EXO:ACC-draw ERG-EF-NTR--1P:NTR--thing
│ ➥ It is me who drew it.
└─
┌───────────────
│ ◆ Inayá tayewaθutákı.
│ ❖ ASR.SEN-1P:NTR--thing  NTR--BG-CUQ-NTR--EXO:ACC-draw
│ ➥ All who drew it is me.
│   / The one who drew it is me.
└─
```

◉ The **Presuppositional Marker**, or **Background Marker**, ⟪-ay-⟫, indicates elements that are presupposed to exist, or presupposed to be true in the sentence. Presuppositions stand out more in non-assertive sentences, such as interrogative sentences:

```
┌───────────────
│ ◆ Ikayá tayaθutákı.
│ ❖ ASR.SEN-1P:NTR--thing  NTR--BG-NTR--EXO:ACC-draw
│ ➥ Are you the one(s) who drew it?
│   ⸨Presupposition: someone drew it.⸩
└─
┌───────────────
│ ◆ Mułčʼé tayakaıcʰuʎún.
│ ❖ PQ-ill  NTR--BG-NTR--2P:EXT-same:ACC-biological_parent
│ ➥ Is your (biological) sibling ill?
│   ⸨Presupposition: you have a (biological) sibling.⸩
└─
┌───────────────
│ ◆ Mukıtʰú kayaoθıraoθı̋čıl.
│ ❖ PQ-2P:ERG-expect  NTR--BG-PCCS-EXO:ERG-RET-give_birth
│ ➥ Do you know that she has given birth?
│   ⸨Presupposition: she has given birth.⸩
└─
```

◉ The **Abstract Property** ⟪-oy-⟫ is essentially a shorthand for unary template clauses; it is comparable to an infinitive.

```
┌───────────────
│ ◆ Ikïyéwa qoyenïpákı.
│ ❖ ASR.SEN-1P:DAT-grateful  MIS-PROP-PEG-1:DAT-help
│ ➥ I am grateful to you for helping me.
└─
```
This sentences means the same as ⟪Ikïyéwa qoıtʼenïpákı⟫ (using the ⟪oı⟫ subordinator), but unlike that latter, it does not open a subordinate clause.

## Scope prefixes

Optionally, a Scope prefix can precede a determinacy affixes.

```  
┌────────────────────────┬────┐  
│ Middle scope (default) │ ∅  │  
│ High scope             │ aʼ │  
│ Low scope              │ ıʼ │ 
└────────────────────────┴────┘  
```  

A high-scope determinacy will have logical scope over all other determinacies in the same clause.  
A low-scope determinacy will conversely be below the scope of all other explicit determinacies, but still have higher scope than covert existential quantification of contentives lacking any overt determinacy marking.
