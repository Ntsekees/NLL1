# Root Verb roles

A sentence may contain only one root verb, or “main verb”, and it is always the first word of the sentence. When a root verb occurs in a stream of words, it signals that a new sentence begins at that position.

A root verb alone is sufficient as a complete sentence. A root verb has a set of core complements specified by its stem, each being associated with a grammatical case. When any of these core complements is not explicitly present, it is covertly existentially quantified, i.e. it's set to “something or somebody”.  
  
There are several different Role prefixes that create root verbs; they further show additional information, namely the illocution (speech act) of the sentence, and if that illocution is the ‘Assertive’, then they also indicate Evidentiality, i.e. the kind of evidence that is the basis for the claim being made with the utterance.  
The Illocution indicates whether the sentence is an assertion (a description of what the speaker thinks is reality), a question, a command, a request, a performative/declarative act, and so on.  
  
Below is a list of the possible root verb prefixes. 
  
* **Assertive illocution**: further inflects for evidentialities, shown below:  
  * **aı-**:   assertion of unspecified evidentiality.  
  * **oı-**:   imformation confirmed from multiple different independent sources of information.  
  * **a-**:    inference from a combination of information from several sources.  
  * **ı-**:    sensory information from current perception.  
  * **eo-**:   intuition.  
  * **u-**:    recollection, memory of past experiences (but not memorized encyclopedic facts, for which Reportives or Epistemic should be used).  
  * **ıwa-**:  information obtained from sensorial recordings made by external devices (photographic or video camera, sound recorders…)  
  * **o-**:    report, hearsay, second-hand information.  
  * **ao-**:   trustworthy report.  
  * **eı-**:   untrustworty report.  
  * **e-**:    epistemic, collective knowledge, not personally verified.  
  * **aya-**:  axiomatic, base beliefs not open to questioning.  
  
* **Non-assertive illocutions**:  
  * **ï-**:    performative: utterance true merely by virtue of being uttered.  
  * **ma-**:   verificative: request of confirmation, “… isn't it?”.  
  * **mı-**:   polar interrogative, yes-no question.  
  * **mu-**:   content interrogative, “wh” question (“what?”, “who?”, “which?”, “when?”, “where?”, “how”? “why?”, etc.).  
  * **maı-**:  rethorical polar interrogative.  
  * **mao-**:  rethorical content interrogative.  
  * **kʰa-**:  directive: order with implied threat, negative consequences if unfulfilled.  
  * **kʰo-**:  requestive: request with implied disappointment if unfulfilled.  
  * **kʰu-**:  invitative/solicitive: mild request with no obligation of fulfillment, no grudge if not accepted.  
  * **kʰı-**: recommandative.  
  * **kʰaı-**:  permission-seeking.  
  * **yea-**: permissive: expression of permission.
  * **yao-**:  oblative: disinterested offers (*“I'm available for…”*, *“if you're interested…”*, *“if you want…”*).  

The content interrogative illocutions go hand-in-hand with the lambda pronominal extension ⟪-tʼ◈-⟫, which plays here the role of the content interrogative pronoun “what”. There is do distinct pronoun for “who”.

Note: Whilst there's a prefix for granting permission, ⟪kʰaı-⟫, there's no dedicated one for prohibition, for that latter is expressed with negative imperatives instead:
