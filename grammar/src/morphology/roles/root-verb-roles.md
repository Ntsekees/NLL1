# Root Verb roles

A sentence may contain only one root verb, or “main verb”, and it is always the first word of the sentence. When a root verb occurs in a stream of words, it signals that a new sentence begins at that position.  
  
There are several different Role prefixes that create root verbs; they further show additional information, namely the illocution (speech act) of the sentence, and if that illocution is the ‘Assertive’, then they also indicate Evidentiality, i.e. the kind of evidence that is the basis for the claim being made with the utterance.  
The Illocution indicates whether the sentence is an assertion (a description of what the speaker thinks is reality), a question, a command, a request, a performative/declarative act, and so on.  
  
Here are the possible root verb prefixes:  
  
• Assertive illocution: further inflects for evidentialities, shown below:  
  aı-:   unspecified evidentiality.  
  oı-:   confirmation from multiple different independent sources of information.  
  a-:    inference from a combination of information from several sources.  
  ı-:    sensorial: information from current perception.  
  eo-:   intuition.  
  u-:    recollection/memory of past experiences (but not memorized encyclopedic facts, for which Reportives or Epistemic should be used).  
  ıwa-:  information obtained from sensorial recordings made by external devices (photographic or video camera, sound recorders…)  
  o-:    report, hearsay, second-hand information.  
  ao-:   trustworthy report.  
  eı-:   untrustworty report.
