# Noun roles

 
With noun roles, as well as modificative and adverbial roles, Slot 2 is subdivised into the following subslots:  
  
```  
┌────┬───────┬──────────────────────────────┐  
│ №  │ Form  │  Name                        │  
├────┼───────┼──────────────────────────────┤  
│ 2a │  C    │  Outer Case                  │  
├────┼───────┼──────────────────────────────┤  
│ 2b │ Vy/Vw │  Determinacy                 │  
├────┼───────┼──────────────────────────────┤  
│ 2c │ V(ʼV) │  Inner Case OR Subordinator  │  
└────┴───────┴──────────────────────────────┘  
```  
  
There are two kinds of cases:  
• Core cases, which indicate which slot of the predicate is selected;  
• Adjunct cases, which are of circumstantial nature.  
  
Nouns bear two case affixes:  
• The outer case, or external case, indicates the relationship between the noun and the main verb of the clause;  
• The inner case, or internal case, indicates which argument slot of the predicate represented by the noun's root is used for defining the noun (for example, with the root ‘to eat’, which expresses a binary relation between two participants, each represented by a case —the eater and the eaten thing—, selecting the first slot would yield a noun ‘eater’, whilst selecting the second case would yield a noun ‘eaten thing’).  
In essence, Nahaıwa nouns may be analyzed as being one-word noun relative clauses, with the stem having a verbal meaning, and the inner case indicating which of the verb complements is the antecedent of the relative clause. Thusly, “eater” (“eat” + Ergative inner case) can be reworder using a relative clause as “that which eats”, “the one who eats”.
  
Instead of an inner case value, slot 2c may contain one of several Subordinator values (those will be covered later).  
  
The outer case is represented by a consonantal prefix, followed by a vocalic affix indicating the second case. A further optional -Vy- or -Vw- affix, the Determinacy affix, may optionally occur in between them (its purpose will be explained later on).  
  
The language exhibits an extended form of the tripartite alignment. Word roots represent predicates with an arity/valency between zero and four, i.e. governing at most four different arguments. Each predicate arity has its own set of case affixes: unary predicates govern only one case, binary predicates have two, ternary predicates have three, and so on. Predicates of a certain arity cannot govern case affixes belonging to a different arity: there is a form of agreement between cases and predicate arity.  
  
## Core noun case affixes:  
  
OC ≝ External/outer case  
IC ≝ Internal/inner case  
  
```  
┌─────────────┬────┬─────┬──────────────┐
│    Arity    │ OC │ IC  │     Name     │
├─────────────┼────┼─────┼──────────────┤
│ Unary:      │ t  │ a   │ Intransitive │
├─────────────┼────┼─────┼──────────────┤
│ Binary:     │ c  │ ı   │ Ergative     │
│             │ k  │ u   │ Accusative   │
├─────────────┼────┼─────┼──────────────┤
│ Ternary:    │ č  │ e   │ Pegative     │
│             │ p  │ ï   │ Dative       │
│             │ q  │ o   │ Missive      │
└─────────────┴────┴─────┴──────────────┘
```  
  
Other core cases:  
```  
┌──────────────┬─────┬─────┐  
│ Extensional: │  cʰ │ aı  │   
│ Eventive:    │  š  │ aï  │  
│ Situative:   │  tʰ │ uʼı │  
└──────────────┴─────┴─────┘  
```  
  
For binary and ternary predicates, the cases shown in the table are ordered according to an animacy or temporal/causal hierarchy: the first participant is the most animate, or the one triggering or exercicing the most control over the event described by the predicate, or occasionally, in the case of stative relations, it may be the largest or most concrete participant. Abstract propositions, properties and relations have lowest rank in this hierarchy, and will typically be associated with the last cases of each case list.  
  
Below are some examples of internal and external case uses with unary roots and stems (`-lı̋`, “asleep”; `-kóyu`, “dog”, `-cʰakóyu`, “the dog”):
```  
┌───────────────
│ ◆ Iθalı̋.
│ ❖ ASR.SEN-EXO:NTR-asleep
│ ➥ It is asleep.
└─
┌───────────────
│ ◆ Ilı̋ tacʰakóyu.
│ ❖ ASR.SEN-asleep NTR-NTR-DEF:NTR-dog
│ ➥ The dog is asleep.
└─
```

Examples with the binary root `-ñú`, “eat”:
```
┌───────────────
│ ◆ Unıθuñú.
│ ❖ ASR.REC-1P:ERG-DEF:ACC-eat
│ ➥ (I recall that) I ate it.
└─
┌───────────────
│ ◆ Unıñú kacʰastíñu.
│ ❖ ASR.REC-1P:ERG-eat  ACC-NTR-DEF:NTR-food
│ ➥ (I recall that) I ate the food.
└─

```

Below is an explanation of the functions of the other core cases mentioned in the second table above.  
  
• The Extensional Case, or ‘Affixal Case’, is governed by certain extensional prefixes, which intoduces a new participant to the relationship expressed by the verb. For example, a causative extensional prefix will add a ‘causer’ participant, which will then be accessible via the Affixal Case.  
  
```
┌───────────────
│ ◆ Unaıqaoñú cacʰakóyu.
│ ❖ ASR.REC-1P:EXT-CAUS-eat  ACC-NTR-DEF:NTR-dog
│ ➥ (I recall that) I made the dog eat (something).
└─
┌───────────────
│ ◆ Uqaoñú cʰıcʰıʎáoko cacʰakóyu kacʰastíñu.
│ ❖ ASR.REC-CAUS-eat  EXT-ERG-DEF:ERG-take_care
│   ERG-NTR-DEF:NTR-dog  ACC-NTR-DEF:NTR-food
│ ➥ (I recall that) the caretaker made the dog eat the food.
└─
```
  
• The Eventive Case may appear with pretty much any verb; it marks a noun that refers to a spatiotemporal event corresponding to the abstract proposition expressed by the verb.  

```
┌───────────────
│ ◆ Iθırí šunıʎáıwa.
│ ❖ ASR.SEN-EXO:ERG-walk_on  EV-ACC-1P:ERG-find_beautiful
│ ➥ They walk in a manner that is beatiful to me.
└─
┌───────────────
│ ◆ Inıʎáıwa kaïθırí.
│ ❖ ASR.SEN-1P:ERG-find_beautiful  ACC-EV-EXO:ERG-walk_on
│ ➥ I find beautiful their walking.
└─
```

• The Situative Case marks nouns referring to a world or a volume of spacetime within which the proposition expressed by the verb is true. For it to apply, the event and the target spacetime area must be entirely encompassed by the referent of the marked noun.  
  
  
## Non-core (adjunct) cases:

```  
┌───────────────┬─────┬─────┐  
│ Pendent       │  ƛ  │     │  
│ Instrumental  │  ƛʼ │     │  
│ SP Locative   │  s  │ eı  │  
└───────────────┴─────┴─────┘  
```  
 
• The Pendent Case introduces a noun phrase without stating any relation between it and the current clause, and binds it to the Pendent pronoun (whose root form is ⟪-ƛá⟫ and whose extensional form is ⟪-ƛ◈-⟫, with ⟪◈⟫ representing an Inner Case vowel). This allows the introduced noun phrase (now bound to the pendent pronoun) to be used latter, possibly in a subordinate clause not yet opened. This is especially useful for expressing quantification binding a variable that is not used in the same clause as the one in which the quantifier appears, but rather in a more deeply nested clause:  
```  
┌───────────────  
│ ◆ Inıŋıwá ƛeyahakú koıtʼıƛucál. (= Inıŋıcál keyahakú.)  
│ ❖ ASR.SEN-1:ERG-want:ERG-has_property  
│   PND-UQZ-NTR-not-universal_property  
│   NOM-UTC-lambda_1:ERG-PND_PN:NOM-see  
│ ➥ Not everything is such that I want to see them.  
└─  
```  
  
• The Instrumental Case marks a noun referring to an instrument used by the referent of the most animate slot of the verb (e.g. the ⟪c-⟫ Case slot of binary predicates, the ⟪p-⟫ case slot of ternary predicates…) for achieving the action described by the current clause.  

```  
┌───────────────  
│ ◆ Iθewétakı qoyakóyu ƛʼaƛʰísı.  
│ ❖ ASR.SEN꞊EXO:PEG-draws_depiction MIS-PROP-NTR-is_a_dog  
│   INS-NTR-is_a_pencil
│ ➥ They draw (a representation of) dogness, using a pencil.  
└─  
```  
  
• The Spatiotemporal Locative Case marks nouns referring to a volume of spacetime where the event described is taking place. For it to apply, the event and the target spacetime area must simply overlap, the event needs not be entirely encompassed by that area.
