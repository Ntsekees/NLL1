## Proforms

As mentioned earlier, Nahaıwa pronominals are expressed as extensional prefixes, more specifically of type −+, with a variable inner case vowel.

Here are some of the main pronominals:

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| n◈   | I/me (singular speaker, or rarely, multiple authors of a same utterance, as in written joint work) |
| k◈   | you (addressee, either singular or plural, never including absent third parties) |
| ŋk◈  | me + you |
| θ◈   | you know what/who (contextually ascertainable 3rd person) |
| nt◈  | that which I am pointing to or looking at (pointing demonstrative) |
| t◈   | resumptive pronominal (refers to the antecedent in relative clauses) |
| tʼ◈  | monovalent lambda pronominal (covers the interrogative “what” among other uses) |

The plural *“we”* has no dedicated pronominal, but can be expressed by adding the associative plural extension ⟪**-nθ◈-**⟫ right after ⟪**-n◈-**⟫, with the same inner case vowel: ⟪**-n◈nθ◈-**⟫ (*“me and co.”*).

They all can be used as full words by combinging them with the dummy root ⟪**-yá**⟫, *⟪[NTR] is a thing, is something⟫*, with the Intransitive inner case vowel ⟪**-a-**⟫: ⟪**-nayá**⟫ ≍ *⟪[NTR] is me⟫*.
