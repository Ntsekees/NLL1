# Slot #1: Binding
  
The general purpose of that slot is to indicate which clausal nesting level the word belongs to, i.e. where the word does ‘bind’. This has however nothing to do with the concept of variable binding.  
  
This slot is always empty on the sentence's main verb (the root verb).  
  
The null/empty form of this slot indicates that the word is a new term in the current clause level.  
  
All the other morpheme belonging to this slot are proclitics; below is a non-exhaustive list of them:  
  
  • ⟪m⟫, the syllabic nasal clitic. This syllabic nasal is preceded by an unwritten glottal stop. Furthermore, it may assimilate in place of articulation with the following consonant (see `§ Morphophonology and Morphology` for details).  
    This clitic may occur on nouns and adverbials and indicates that the word is a complement of the predicate underlying the immediately preceding contentive word, as opposed to being an independent complement of the main predicate of the current clause.  
  • ⟪θa⟫: indicates that the current clause is terminated and the word marked with this clitic belongs to the next outer clause, and is a continuation thereof.  
  • ⟪kʼwa⟫: indicates the closure of two clauses, so that the marked word belongs to the third-to-last opened clause in the order of clause nesting.
