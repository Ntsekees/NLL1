# Syntax  
  
The language's syntax is highly head-initial, with some exceptions.  
A sentence always begins with a root verb, and there can be no more than one root verb per sentence. It is formally recognizable by bearing an Illocution role prefix; this doubles as an indicator of the beginning of a new sentence.  
Fragment sentences, not containing any root verb, are not allowed in the language. It is mandatory to provide at least a dummy verb of some sort. When the speaker wishes not to put at the very beginning of the sentence the salient semantic content that should normally be expressed by the root verb, a dummy auxiliary-like root verb is used, and the semantic content whose appearance is to be delayed is instead demoted to a noun phrase governed by the dummy root verb. This allows word order flexibility while retaining the advantages of a rigidly verb-initial syntax.  
  
The root verb is the only true verb in the sentence; subordinate clauses are headed by a participle, which, from the point of view of the inside of the clause, acts as its verb; but from the outside of the subordinate clause, the participle looks like a noun or a word of another part of speech such as an adjective or an adverb, by taking the role prefix corresponding to that part of speech.
