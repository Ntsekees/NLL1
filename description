§ Introduction

Nahaıwa, also known as Haıwa or NLL1 (acronym for ⟪Ntsékees' Logical Language #1⟫) is a prototype of a constructed monosemic language, i.e. a loglang: syntactic ambiguities are disallowed, as well as word polysemy and homonymy not resolvable through syntax alone, as well as opaque idiomatic expressions not explicitly marked as such. It is also an artlang, inasmuch as aesthetics (in the eyes of the author) is taken into account.
It is currently in a developmental stage of early prototype, and the description given here may be obsoleted by future changes to the language. The development of the language started in mid 2016.
The language exhibits ‘scopal polysynthesis’, i.e. words may contain an arbitrary number of recursively stacked affixes —in this case, prefixes— with transparent meanings, called “extensional prefixes”. Its morphology is purely prefixal, of agglutinative nature with some portmanteau morphemes. There are three main lexically-assigned categories of lexical units:
• contentives (which may assume the syntactic roles of verb, noun, participle, adjective, adverb, conjunction or quantifier, depending on the way they are inflected);
• inflecting functors / functional words (these have exactly the same morphology as contentives, but have special effects on the surrounding syntax);
• uninflected functors, i.e. particles.

Functors are closed classes, and they have a fairly small number of members.

The vocabulary is a priori, not derived or borrowed from that of existing natural or constructed languages.

The consonant inventory is large (36 consonants), and mainly inspired by the inventories of Athabascan languages, as well as Aymara and Quechua languages.

§ Phonology

§§ Vowel phonemes

There are 6 vowel phonemes:

┌─────────────┐┌─────────────┐
│ IPA         ││ Spelling    │
├─────────────┤├─────────────┤
│  i   ɨ   u  ││  ı   ï   u  │
│  e̞       o̞  ││  e       o  │
│      ä      ││      a      │
└─────────────┘└─────────────┘

There are 6 diphthongs:

┌──────────────┐┌──────────────┐
│ IPA          ││ Spelling     │
├──────────────┤├──────────────┤
│  e̞i̯      o̞i̯  ││  eı      oı  │
│  e̞o̞̯          ││  eo          │
│  äi̯  äɨ̯  äo̞̯  ││  aı  aï  ao  │
└──────────────┘└──────────────┘

/äi̯/ may be pronounced [äe̯] in a closed syllable, or [äj] when the next syllable begins with the consonant /j/, in which case the approximant is geminated at the syllable boundary: /äi̯.jä/ → [äj.jä].
Similarly, /äo̯/ may be pronounced [äw] when immediately preceding a syllable beginning with /w/: /äo̯.wä/ → [äw.wä]. /e̞o̯/ behaves similarly.

Vowels immediately preceding the uvular plosive /q/ may undergo slight lowering and backening, as shown below:
  [i] → [ɪ]
  [e̞] → [ɛ]
  [ɨ] → [ɘ]
  [ä] → [ɑ]
  [u] → [ʊ]
  [o̞] → [ɔ]

Prominent syllables are indicated in the Latin orthography with acute accent marks. In the case of dipthongs, the first vowel member bears the acute accent. The letter ⟪ï⟫ becomes ⟪i̋⟫ when prominent (i.e. bearing a double-acute accent mark).


════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

§§ Consonant phonemes

There are 36 consonant phonemes:

└──────────────────────────┘└──────────────────────────┘

Word-initial glottal stops are not written explicitly in the romanization orthography.


§§§ Consonant allophony:

  • /h/ is realized as [ç] before /i/, or after /i/ if no vowel is following this /h/;
    similarly, it is realized as [ç̱] (prevelar fricative) before /ɨ/ or after it if no vowel is following this /h/,
    and likewise [x] before /u/, or after it if no vowel follows;
    in other situations, it remains realized as [h].
  • /t͡ɬ/ and its variants (aspirated, ejective) are realized as [k͡ʟ̝̊] (and aspirated and ejective variants, respectively) when between a /u/ and a consonant or word break; the same realization may optionally occur immediately before a /u/ vowel.
  • /w/, when occurring immediately after a consonant, especially a velar or uvular one, is realized as labialization of that consonant.


════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

§ Phonotactics

All words except particles contain at least two syllables.
Words cannot begin on a vowel; in the romanization, words that are written with a vowel as their first letter actually have an unwritten glottal stop onset preceding the vowel.


════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

§§ Pitch accent

All words bear a pitch accent, or ‘word-tone’, which is a tone contour that extends across the whole word, and which emphasizes one specific syllable called the ‘prominent syllable’, homologuous to the stressed syllable in stress-based languages. In this language, words always begin with a pitch level that is low but still at least a little higher than the pitch level of the last syllable of the immediately preceding word in the same breathe group, if any. Then, until the prominent syllable is met (it is marked in the romanization orthography with an acute accent or a double acute accent), which bears the highest pitch of the whole word, any of the two following scenarios are possible, in free variation: ① each syllable's pitch is a little higher than that of the preceding syllable, or ② the pitch remains flats, mid-level, until the prominent syllable is met, where the pitch raises to a peak. After the prominent syllable, the pitch goes down more or less abruptly until the end of the word is reached. There again, the pitch level may become low and flat after the prominent syllable is passed, especially if the word is long (as it may not be comfortable to keep the pitch going progressively down on a long word).


════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

§§ Syllable structure

/ʎi/ and /ɲi/ are not allowed, except possibly as allophonic realizations of /li/ and /ni/ respectively.

Words never begin with a consonant clusters, with a few exceptions:
• /w/ may appear after certain consonants, and is realized as labialization of the preceding consonant.
• One of the Binding proclitics, the nasal proclitic /ʔm̩꞊/, realized as a syllabic nasal (a bilabial one most of the time) preceded by an unwritten glottal stop, can appear at the beginning of a word immediately before another consonant; the syllabic nasal assimilates in place of articulation with certain (not all) consonants:
  ◉ coronal plosives and affricates (/ʔm̩꞊t/ → [ʔn̩꞊t]);
  ◉ velar plosives (/ʔm̩꞊k/ → [ʔŋ̩꞊k]).
It is noteworthy that it does not assimilate with a following uvular plosive: /ʔm̩꞊q/ → [ʔm̩꞊q].
The assimilation is shown in the romanized orthography:
  /ʔm̩꞊takóju/ → ⟪ntakóyu⟫.

Similarly, the coda of the last syllable of a word never contains a consonant cluster.

Consonant clusters may only occur across syllable boundaries, where two-consonant clusters and more rarely three-consonant clusters may occur.

⸨TODO: List allowed and disallowed clusters.⸩


════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

§§ Word boundaries

When a word ending on a tenuis plosive or affricate is immediately followed by a word starting with a fricative, an epenthetic short voiceless [ɨ̥] or [ə̥] appears between the two as a small buffer between the two words.


════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

§ Morphophonology and Morphology

As indicated earlier, there are three morphological classes of words:
• contentives (open class: the lexical words used to refer to the concepts being talked about in the utterance);
• inflecting function words (closed class; morphophonologically indistinguishable from contentives, but differing from the latters by having special effects on the surrounding syntax);
• indeclinable, uninflected function words, AKA particles (closed class).

Function words are closed classes, i.e. they have a limited, restricted membership, no new members are added to them, or only rarely.

In the language, function words are few, as many grammatical functions are expressed as inflection of contentive words.

We will proceed by examining the morphophonology of contentives (which is the same as that of inflecting function words), and a list of function words —together with their function— will be given afterwards.


════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

§§ Contentives

The morphology of the contentive is an agglutinative template of four slots, described by the table below, starting with the first slot as the first row and ending with the last slot:

┌───┬────────────┬────────────────┐
│ № │ Form       │  Name          │
├───┼────────────┼────────────────┤
│ 1 │ CV         │  Binding       │
├───┼────────────┼────────────────┤
│ 2 │ C(VG)V(ʼV) │  Role          │
├───┼────────────┼────────────────┤
│ 3 │ C(VG)V*    │  Extensions    │
├───┼────────────┼────────────────┤
│ 4 │ CV(CV…)(C) │  Root or base  │
└───┴────────────┴────────────────┘

⟪C⟫ ≝ any consonant; ⟪V⟫ ≝ any vowel or diphthong; ⟪G⟫ ≝ any glide/semivowel.

(The asterisk means that the slot is optional and recursive, i.e. its may contain zero, one, two or more values strung together.)

Slot 1, 3 are optional; the other ones are mandatory.

However, the Role slot may further be subdivised into up to three further subslots when the word is inflected for certain syntactic functions (mainly functions others than that of matrix verb):

┌────┬───────┬────────────────┐
│ №  │ Form  │  Name          │
├────┼───────┼────────────────┤
│ 2a │  C    │  Outer Case    │
├────┼───────┼────────────────┤
│ 2b │ Vy/Vw │  Determinacy   │
├────┼───────┼────────────────┤
│ 2c │ V(ʼV) │  Inner Case    │
└────┴───────┴────────────────┘

Out of these, slot 2b is optional; the two others must appear together.

We will now examine each of the slots one by one.


§§§ Binding Slot

The general purpose of that slot is to indicate which clausal nesting level the word belongs to, i.e. where the word does ‘bind’. This has however nothing to do with the concept of variable binding.

This slot is always empty on matrix verbs.

The null/empty form of this slot indicates that the word is a new term in the current clause level.

All the other morpheme belonging to this slot are proclitics; below is a non-exhaustive list of them:

  • ⟪m⟫, the syllabic nasal clitic. This syllabic nasal is preceded by an unwritten glottal stop. Furthermore, it may assimilate in place of articulation with the following consonant (see `§ Morphophonology and Morphology` for details).
    This clitic may occur on nouns and adverbials and indicates that the word is a complement of the predicate underlying the immediately preceding contentive word, as opposed to being an independent complement of the main predicate of the current clause.
  • ⟪θa⟫: indicates that the current clause is terminated and the word marked with this clitic belongs to the next outer clause, and is a continuation thereof.
  • ⟪kʼwa⟫: indicates the closure of two clauses, so that the marked word belongs to the third-to-last opened clause in the order of clause nesting.
  • ...


§§§ Role Slot

This slot may be subdivised into further subslots in certain cases.

§§§§ Matrix Verb Roles

A sentence may contain only one matrix verb, and it is always the first word of the sentence. When a matrix verb occurs in a stream of words, it signals that a new sentence begins at that position.

There are several different Role prefixes that create matrix verbs; they further show additional information, namely the illocution (speech act) of the sentence, and if that illocution is the ‘Assertive’, then they also indicate Evidentiality, i.e. the kind of evidence that is the basis for the claim being made with the utterance.
The Illocution indicates whether the sentence is an assertion (a description of what the speaker thinks is reality), a question, a command, a request, a performative/declarative act, and so on.

Here are the possible matrix verb prefixes:

• Assertive illocution: further inflects for evidentialities, shown below:
  aı-:   unspecified evidentiality.
  oı-:   confirmation from multiple different independent sources of information.
  a-:    inference from a combination of information from several sources.
  ı-:    sensorial: information from current perception.
  eo-:   intuition.
  u-:    recollection/memory of past experiences (but not memorized encyclopedic facts, for which Reportives or Epistemic should be used).
  ıwa-:  information obtained from sensorial recordings made by external devices (photographic or video camera, sound recorders…)
  o-:    report, hearsay, second-hand information.
  ao-:   trustworthy report.
  eı-:   untrustworty report.
  e-:    epistemic, collective knowledge, not personally verified.
  aya-:  axiomatic, base beliefs not open to questioning.

• Non-assertive illocutions:
  ɨ-:    performative
  ma-:   request of confirmation, “… isn't it?”
  mu-:   polar interrogative
  mı-:   content interrogative
  mao-:  rethorical polar interrogative
  maı-:  rethorical content interrogative
  kʰa-:  directive (order with implied threat)
  kʰo-:  petitive (demand; strong, earnest request)
  kʰu-:  requestive (implied disappointment if unfulfilled)
  kʰe-:  solicitive (mild request, no obligation of fulfillment)
  kʰı-:  oblative (disinterested offers: “I'm available for…”, “if you're interested…”)
  kʰao-: recommandative


§§§§ Noun Roles

With noun roles, as well as adjectival and adverbial roles, Slot 2 is subdivised into the following subslots:

┌────┬───────┬────────────────┐
│ №  │ Form  │  Name          │
├────┼───────┼────────────────┤
│ 2a │  C    │  Outer Case    │
├────┼───────┼────────────────┤
│ 2b │ Vy/Vw │  Determinacy   │
├────┼───────┼────────────────┤
│ 2c │ V(ʼV) │  Inner Case    │
└────┴───────┴────────────────┘

There are two kinds of cases:
• Core cases, which indicate which slot of the predicate is selected;
• Adjunct cases, which are of circumstantial nature.

Nouns bear two case affixes:
• The outer case, or external case, indicates the relationship between the noun and the main verb of the clause;
• The inner case, or internal case, indicates which argument slot of the predicate represented by the noun's root is used for defining the noun (for example, with the root ‘to eat’, which expresses a binary relation between two participants, each represented by a case —the eater and the eaten thing—, selecting the first slot would yield a noun ‘eater’, whilst selecting the second case would yield a noun ‘eaten thing’).

The outer case is represented by a consonantal prefix, followed by a vocalic affix indicating the second case. A further optional -Vy- or -Vw- affix, the Determinacy affix, may optionally occur in between them (its purpose will be explained later on).

The language exhibits an extended form of the tripartite alignment. Word roots represent predicates with an arity/valency between zero and four, i.e. governing at most four different arguments. Each predicate arity has its own set of case affixes: unary predicates govern only one case, binary predicates have two, ternary predicates have three, and so on. Predicates of a certain arity cannot govern case affixes belonging to a different arity: there is a form of agreement between cases and predicate arity.

Core noun case affixes:

OC ≝ External/outer case
IC ≝ Internal/inner case

Other core cases:
┌─────────────┬─────┬─────┐

│ Affixal:    │  kʼ │ aı  │ 
│ Eventive:   │  š  │ aï  │
│ Situative:  │  tʰ │ uʼı │
└─────────────┴─────┴─────┘

For binary, ternary an quaternary predicates, the cases shown in the table are ordered according to an animacy or temporal/causal hierarchy: the first participant is the most animate, or the one triggering or exercicing the most control over the event described by the predicate, or occasionally, in the case of stative relations, it may be the largest or most concrete participants. Abstract propositions, properties and relations have lowest rank in this hierarchy, and will typically be associated with the last cases of each case list.

Below is an explanation of the functions of the other core cases mentioned in the second table above.

• The Dislocated Predicate (DP) Case is governed exclusively by the predicate application root ⟪-tʰá⟫; it marks the noun phrase representing the predicate that is to be applied, ‘unboxed’, by the dummy applicator verb based on the ⟪-tʰá⟫ root, which also takes as its arguments all the arguments required by the applied predicate:
┌───────────────
│ ◆ Aıtʰá tatʼí tʼoıtʼınucál.  =  Aınucál catʼí.
│ ❖ ASR-has_property INTR-INTR-bird
│   DP-UTC-lambda_1:ERG-me:NOM-see_stimulus
│ ➥ A bird has the property of seeing me.  =  A bird sees me.
└─

⸨Note: the predicate applicator root will maybe be replaced with one different applicator root for each allowed arities.⸩

• The Affixal Case is governed by certain extentional prefixes, which intoduces a new participant to the relationship expressed by the verb. For example, a causative extensional prefix will adds a ‘causer’ participant, which will then be accessible via the Affixal Case.

• The Eventive Case may appear with pretty much any verb; it marks a noun that refers to a spatiotemporal event corresponding to the abstract proposition expressed by the verb.

• The Situative Case marks nouns referring to a world or a volume of spacetime within which the proposition expressed by the verb is true. For it to apply, the event and the target spacetime area must be entirely encompassed by the referent of the marked noun.


Non-core (adjunct) cases:
┌───────────────┬─────┬─────┐
│ Topical       │  r  │     │
│ Pendent       │  ł  │     │
│ Instrumental  │  ƛ  │ ıʼa │
│ SP Locative   │  s  │ eı  │
└───────────────┴─────┴─────┘

• The Topical Case marks the topic of the sentence. ⸨Note: it might become deprecated soon.⸩

• The Pendent Case introduces a noun phrase without stating any relation between it and the current clause, and binds it to the Pendent pronoun (whose root form is ⟪-łá⟫ and whose extensional form is ⟪-ł◈-⟫, with ⟪◈⟫ representing an Inner Case vowel). This allows the introduced noun phrase (now bound to the pendent pronoun) to be used latter, possibly in a subordinate clause not yet opened. This is especially useful for expressing quantification binding a variable that is not used in the same clause as the one in which the quantifier appears, but rather in a more deeply nested clause:
┌───────────────
│ ◆ Inıŋıwá łeyahakú koıtʼıłucál. (= Inıŋıcál keyahakú.)
│ ❖ ASR.SEN-want:ERG-has_property
│   PEND-UQZ-INTR-not-universal_property
│   NOM-UTC-lambda_1:ERG-PEND_PN:NOM-see
│ ➥ Not everything is such that I want to see them.
└─

• The Instrumental Case marks a noun referring to an instrument used by the referent of the most animate slot of the verb (e.g. the ⟪c-⟫ Case slot of binary predicates, the ⟪p-⟫ case slot of ternary predicates…) for achieving the action described by the current clause.

• The Spatiotemporal Locative Case marks nouns referring to a volume of spacetime where the event described is taking place. For it to apply, the event and the target spacetime area must simply overlap, the event needs not be entirely encompassed by that area.


Special inner case values:
┌─────────────────────────┬─────┐
│ Relative clause         │ eo  │
│ Content clause          │ ao  │
│ Unary template clause 1 │ oı  │
│ Unary template clause 2 │ ea  │
│ Binary Template Clause  │ oa  │
│ Ternary Template Clause │ ıʼı │
│ Quaternary Template Cl. │ uʼu │
└─────────────────────────┴─────┘

These morphemes occupy the Inner Case slot (slot 2c), but are not true Cases. They turn the words which bear them into ‘participles’, words that have the special syntactic effect of opening a whole subordinate clause (which may be exited for returning to the outer clause by using an appropriate Binding proclitic; see the section `§§§ Binding Slot`). The participle can assume any syntactic roles which normal contentives can assume via outer case inflection: a participle bearing a noun case will be a “noun participle”, with an adverbial case it will be an “adverbial participle”, and so on. Even if all these morphemes cause the opening of a subordinate clause, they differ in what kind of clause is created.

Relative clauses are clauses that refer to one of the participants (called the ‘antecedant’) mentioned within the clause and represented by the ‘resumptive pronoun’ (whose root form is ⟪-tá⟫ and whose extensional form is ⟪-t◈-⟫); the relative clause describes its antecedent, and the whole relative clause's referent is the antecedent itself.

Content clauses, on the other hand, do not involve any resumptive pronoun, and the referent of a content clause is the abstract proposition described by the clause.

Template clauses are similar to content clauses but contain ‘blanks’, parts that have been abstracted away, similarly to blanks in a form, ready to be filled in. A template clause defines a predicate, and each ‘blank’ corresponds to one of the argument slots of the predicate.
Each such blank or slot is represented by a so-called ‘lambda pronoun’ (named after lambda calculus).
There is one vocalic morpheme for each predicate arity, and each arity has its own set of lambda pronouns. Additionally, there are two different morphemes for unary predicates, they only differ in having a different lambda pronoun.

┌─────────────────────────┬─────┬─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Function                │ V   │ Lambda pronoun set              │
├─────────────────────────┼─────┼──────────────────┬──────────────┤

└─────────────────────────┴─────┴─────────────────────────────────┘

The lambda pronouns are shown in their contentive root form, with equivalent extensional prefix forms in the right-hand square (with ⟪◈⟫ standing for an Inner Case vocalic affix); only the unary and binary templates have extensional prefix forms for their lambda pronouns, as they are the most frequent in usage.
It is noteworthy that the consonant of the lambda pronouns is the same as that of corresponding outer case's consonantal morpheme, and the vowel is likewise the same as the vowel of the corresponding inner case.

These Role prefixes (Slot 2a) behave much like noun cases, although the syntactic roles they govern aren't nominal; like noun cases, they are accompanied by an Inner Case vocalic affix, and an optional Determinacy affix.

┌───────────────────┬─────┐
│ Interjective      │  y  │
│ Vocative          │  w  │
│ Plural union      │  n  │
│ Sequential        │  ŋ  │
│ Adjectival        │  l  │
│ Propositional     │  cʼ │
└───────────────────┴─────┘

• The Interjective Case turns a contentive word into an interjection, meaning that the speaker is satisfying the selected case role of the predicate at the present moment.

  ┌───────────────
  │ ◆ Yıƛʼé.
  │ ❖ ITJ-ERG-feel_pain
  │ ➥ Ouch!
  └─

• The Vocative Case indicates the identity of the intended recipient of the utterance, the addressee.

  ┌───────────────
  │ ◆ Waqaséʼ mıkıtʼušatʰıwá.
  │ ❖ VOC-INTR-the_one_named_after_property:INTR-cloud
  │   PQ-you:ERG-lambda_1:NOM-ongoing-is_intentionally:ERG-has_property
  │ ➥ Cloud, what are you doing?
  └─

• The Plural Union Case has a special syntax: instead of complementing the clause's verb, it links together the marked noun and the immediately preceding one, merging them into a single new noun whose referents are the union of the referents of the two target nouns; this corresponds to certain usages of the word ⟪and⟫ and the expression ⟪together with⟫ in English.
  The two following example sentences illustrate the difference between the ‘logical AND’ and the plural union:
  
  ┌───────────────
  │ ◆ Ici̋ tayakóyu ñaʼáı tayaƛúrı ne.
  │ ❖ ASR.SEN-√is_one  INTR-DEF-INTR-√dog  CZ2-√and
  │   INTR-DEF-INTR-√cat  EOT
  │ ➥ Both the dog and the cat are one/single. [EOT]
  └─
  ┌───────────────
  │ ◆ Irú tayakóyu nayaƛúrı ne.
  │ ❖ ASR.SEN-√are_two  INTR-DEF-INTR-√dog
  │   PU-DEF-INTR-√cat  EOT
  │ ➥ The dog together with the cat are two. [EOT]
  └─

• The Sequential Case is used to construct sequences, lists, and is applied to all non-initial members of the list. The first member's case indicates the syntactic role of the whole list.

• The Adjectival Case turns the contentive word into a restrictive adjective modifying the immediately preceding contentive, no matter its syntactic role (even non-nominal roles). The resulting meaning corresponds to that of a ‘logical AND’ conjunction.

  ┌───────────────
  │ ◆ Unınθıcál kacatʼí lalé.
  │ ❖ REC-me:ERG-associative_plural:ERG-see_stimulus
  │   NOM-INTR-one_in_number:INTR-bird ADJ-INTR-blue
  │ ➥ We saw a blue bird. (Something that is blue and is a bird.)
  └─

• The Propositional Case turns the contentive word into a restrictive subordinating clausal adverb, i.e. an adverb that modifies the whole proposition represented by the current clause, and not describing the physical spatiotemporal manifestation (event) of that proposition: it would be suitable for expressing the adverbs "probably", "arguably", "frequently", but not event-specific adverbs such as "beautifully", for which the Eventive Case would be appropriate.


§§§§ Other roles

Let ⟪◈⟫ be a placeholder for an inner case vowel:

┌───────────────────────────────────────┬────────┐
│ Oblique                               │ hu     │
│ ERG-NOM propositional conjunctionizer │ ña     │
│ NOM-ERG propositional conjunctionizer │ ñu     │
│ ERG-NOM eventive conjunctionizer      │ ñaı    │
│ NOM-ERG eventive conjunctionizer      │ ñao    │
│ ERG-NOM binary quantifierizer         │ ʎa     │
│ NOM-ERG binary quantifierizer         │ ʎu     │
│ Afterthought relativizer              │ ʎaı    │
└───────────────────────────────────────┴────────┘

• The ERG-NOM and NOM-ERG conjunctionizers can only be applied to binary roots expressing a relation between two propositions, such as logical connective predicates like ⟪-áı⟫, "and". They convert the binary predicate into an afterthought, interposed conjunction, a conjunction placed between the the two connectands it governs.
  In the case of the ERG-NOM version, the first connectand goes into the ERG slot and the second one in the NOM slot; with the NOM-ERG conjunctionizer, it's the other way around. The difference is insignificant if the binary relation is reflexive, i.e. reciprocal.
  The propositional versions take two propositions as their arguments; the eventive versions take as arguments events instantiating the propositions, i.e. the physical manifestation of these abstract propositions.
  When two noun phrases are conjoined with a conjunction, the two must bear the same noun case. When two verbs in the same clause are conjoined, the second one bears the Oblique Role ⟪hu-⟫.
  A bare Oblique Role, not preceded by a conjunction word, is a shorthand for a logical AND conjoining two verbs, i.e. with the ⟪ñaʼáı⟫ conjunction left out implicit.

  ┌───────────────
  │ ◆ Ici̋ tayakóyu ñaʼáı tayaƛúrı.
  │ ❖ ASR.SEN-√is_one  INTR-DEF-INTR-√dog  CZ2-√and
  │   INTR-DEF-INTR-√cat
  │ ➥ Both the dog and the cat are one/single.
  └─
  ┌───────────────
  │ ◆ Ici̋ tayakóyu (ñaʼáı) hurú tayaƛúrı.
  │ ❖ ASR.SEN-√is_one  INTR-DEF-INTR-√dog  (CZ2-√and)
  │   OBL-√are_two INTR-DEF-INTR-√cat
  │ ➥ The dog is one, and the cats are two.
  └─
  ┌───────────────
  │ ◆ Oθenïyi̋čal qaoci̋ tayakóyu (ñaʼáı) hurú tayaƛúrı.
  │ ❖ ASR.REC-you_know_what:C1/3-me:C2/3-√assert_to
  │   C3/3-CC-√is_one  INTR-DEF-INTR-√dog  (CZ2-√and)
  │   OBL-√are_two INTR-DEF-INTR-√cat
  │ ➥ That one said to me that the dog was one and the cats were two.
  └─

• The two binary quantifierizers function in an homologuous manner to the conjunctionizers, but instead of constructing conjunctions, they do binary quantifiers instead. A binary quantifier is a word that is placed immediately before a noun (with normal noun case inflection), and it defines the relation between the unary property used to define the noun and the unary property defined by the slot of the verb which the noun goes into. Whereas conjunctionizers operate on binary predicates relating two propositions, quantifierizers operate on binary predicates relating two unary properties. Such "quantificational binary predicates" may be examplified by the predicates ⟪➊ is a property that is universal among what has property ➋⟫ (root ⟪-kú⟫), corresponding to the quantifier "all", "every", in the English language. In the sentence "all cats are mammals" can be reworded as "the property of being a mammal is universal among what has the property of being a cat", "mammalhood is universal among what have cathood".
  The Universal Determinacy ⟪-ıw-⟫ and the Existential Determinacy ⟪-uy-⟫ may be regarded as shorthands for a quantifierizer expression.

• The Afterthought Relativizer is a special Role that terminates the current clause (even if it is the matrix clause), binds the proposition described by the clause to the Pendent pronoun, then turn the clause into a pendent-like expression hanging at the beginning of a new clause, whose main verb is the contentive bearing the Afterthought Relativizer Role.

  ┌───────────────
  │ ◆ Aılé tatʼí, ʎaıθenïłoyi̋čal.
  │ ❖ ASR-√is_blue  INTR-INTR-√bird
  │   ATR-you_know_what:C1/3-me:C2/3-lambda_1:C3/3-√assert_to
  │ ➥ The bird was blue, they said to me.
  └─

If the Afterthought Relativizer is used on the matrix clause whose matrix verb bears non-null Evidentiality, then the scope of the Evidentiality remains that of the clause terminated by the Afterthought Relativizer, as opposed of scoping over the whole sentence. The relation between the Evidentiality and the terminated clause is incidental, non-restrictive.

  ┌───────────────
  │ ◆ Olé tatʼí, ʎaıθenïłoyi̋čal.
  │ ❖ ASR.RPT-√is_blue  INTR-INTR-√bird
  │   ATR-you_know_what:C1/3-me:C2/3-lambda_1:C3/3-√assert_to
  │ ➥ I heard that the bird was blue, that's what they said to me (at least).
  └─



§§§ Extension slot

The extension slot is optional, and may contain a string of extensional prefixes of arbitrary length, ordered by their relative scope: each such extensional prefix has semantic scope over all the remaining chain of extensional prefixes that follows it, and each prefix is under the scope of the prefixes that occurred before it. In other words, they express semantically compositional modifications of the word stem on their right: the root plus any other prefix appearing to their right (they are left-branching, right-grouping).

To take an example using English vocabulary, considering three extensional prefixes meaning ‘not’, ‘often’, ‘want’, ordered in this way, the meaning of the whole prefix chain will be "not often wants to…"; but if the order is modified, say ‘want’ ‘often’ ‘not’, the meaning will be "wants to often not do/be…".

Extensional prefixes have compositional, transparent meanings: unlike derivational affixes in many natlangs, the combinations involving roots and extensional prefixes do not require being learnt separately from the meaning of their components; the meaning of such combinations can always be derived from the meanings of the components without any need to looking up combinations in a dictionary.

Extensional prefixes that have fused with the root into a lexicalized combination with an opaque meaning always become part of the root/base itself, i.e. they are no longer located in the Extension slot (that is, the position of the prominent syllable in the word, which always appear on the first syllable of the lexicalized, semantically opaque part of the word, namely the word's root or base, is shifted leftwards so as to engulf any former extensional prefix that would have thusly formed an opaque combination with the root, transforming that former prefix into an element of the root itself, within the Root slot).

Extensional prefixes have shape -C?CV(yV)-: they begin with a single consonant or a consonant cluster followed by a vowel, possibly elongated with a second syllable starting with the ⟪y⟫ semivowel. If they begin with a cluster, the first consonant of the cluster may be phonetically part of the coda of the preceding syllable (the cluster then crosses the syllable boundary): for example, ⟪nta⟫ is a valid extensional prefix, with the ⟪n⟫ part belonging to the preceding syllable.

There exist several types of extensional prefixes, depending on two factors: how many slots of the stem they remove, and whether they add a new slot (bound to the "affixal noun case"). For some prefixes, the vowel part is not meaningful and the whole consonant+vowel is one single monolithic morpheme. However, for some other prefixes, the vowel is meaningful and expresses an Inner Case value, indicating the argument slot of the stem that is specifically targeted by this extensional prefix. Some prefixes may even target two slots at a time, in which case they assume the shape -C?CVyV-, where each of the two vowel segments express a different case.

Below is a list of the different types of extensional prefixes:

• Type 0: no change in valency, does not select/remove any slot.
  Example: -ha- (negation).

• Type +: does not select/remove any slot, but adds an affixal slot.
  Example: (none currently).

• Type −: remove one slot, marked by the vowel form.
  Example: (none currently).

• Type −+: modifies one slot of the stem (sort of removes one and adds one); the vowel marks which slot is selected; the meaning of the slot is modified, but this suffix type does not bind the affixal case, it just reuses the modified case. The resulting valency and case set of the predicate is unchanged.
  Example: -n◈-, «[new slot] is me who satisfies the property of [target slot]», -ƛ◈-, «[new slot] attempts to satisfy the property of [target slot]».

• Type −−+: removes two slots and adds one (bound to the affixal case).
  Example: -kw◈y◈-, «[new slot] are in the reciprocal relationship of [removed pair of slots]».

§§§ Root slot

The root slot is the last slot of the morphological template of contentive words; it is demarcated from the remaining of the word by having its first syllable being the prominent syllable of the word's pitch accent: it is the syllable with the highest pitch in the word. The pitch only goes down along the remaining of the root and doesn't raise up again. In the romanization orthography, the prominent syllable, and therefore the first syllable of the root slot, in marked with an acute accent mark (or a double acute) on its first vowel.

The root slot must contain at least one syllable; similarly to extensional prefixes, when it begins with a consonant cluster, the cluster may cross the syllable boundary with the preceding syllable, such that the first consonant is actually the coda of that preceding syllable. Thus, ⟪nté⟫ is a valid root, for example.

The root, and therefore the whole word as well, may end with a single consonant, but not with a consonant cluster.

The root slot may contain a single root, or a string of several roots, possibly even accompanied by fossilized former extensional prefixes, now merged with the root(s). If the root slot contains more than a single root, it may be more accurate to qualify its content of ‘word base’. There is no morphophonological structures that allows to unambiguously segment the content of the root slot (if polysyllabic) into individual subcomponents: when an unkown polysyllabic word base is met, it cannot be determined with certainty whether it is a single monolithic root, or a composition of fossilized prefixes and roots, or a string of two or more roots.
However, since word bases are always lexicalized, i.e. semantically opaque, the recognizability of subcomponents only offers a value in enhencing memorization and offering meaning hints for those discovering the word for the first time; the meaning of the whole word base must be learnt independently of the meaning of its eventual subconstituents: word bases are atomic lexical units of the language.

§§ Function words

§§§ Declinable functors (contentive-like function words)

┌─────────────────────────────┬────────┐

  │ ➥ I said to them «I don't understand it».
  └─

The foreign quote initiator root ⟪-qʼwáı⟫ introduces a quote of foreign material, terminated by the particle ⟪qʼwáı⟫ (with a falling tone).
The foreign material is rendered phonetically (with variable precision; phonetic notation can never achieve absolute precision anyway).
In speech, a short silence may be placed between the quote delimiters and the quoted content, although it'll most often be not necessary, unless the quote begins on a vowel or on an instance of ⟪qʼwaı⟫ with a low tone, or ends with ⟪qʼwaı⟫ with a high tone.
If the quoted material contains the syllable ⟪qʼwáı⟫ with a falling tone, then the delimiter can be reduplicated for avoiding this quoted ⟪qʼwáı⟫ to be misinterpreted as the end-of-quote delimiter; the quote will then be enclosed between ⟪-qʼwáıqʼwaı⟫ and ⟪qʼwáıqʼwaı⟫ (with a falling tone extending over the whole word). Similarly, if the quote contains ⟪qʼwáıqʼwaı⟫, then the delimiter syllable can be tripled (⟪qʼwáıqʼwaıqʼwaı⟫), and so on ad infinitum.

Examples (with _ representing a short pause):

• ⟪ Uθupá kaqʼwáı _ aı dɐnt ɐndəstǽnd _ qʼwáı. ⟫
  “You-know-who said «I don't understand».”

• ⟪ Uθupá kaqʼwáıqʼwaı _ qʼwaı _ qʼwáıqʼwaı. ⟫
  “You-know-who said «qʼwai».”

§ Syntax

The language's syntax is highly head-initial, with some exceptions.
A sentence always begins with a matrix verb, and there can be no more than one matrix verb per sentence. It is formally recognizable by bearing an Illocution role prefix; this doubles as an indicator of the beginning of a new sentence.
Fragment sentences, not containing any matrix verb, are not allowed in the language. It is mandatory to provide at least a dummy verb of some sort. When the speaker wishes not to put at the very beginning of the sentence the salient semantic content that should normally be expressed by the matrix verb, a dummy auxiliary-like matrix verb is used, and the semantic content whose appearance is to be delayed is instead demoted to a noun phrase governed by the dummy matrix verb. This allows word order flexibility while retaining the advantages of a rigidly verb-initial syntax.

The matrix verb is the only true verb in the sentence; subordinate clauses are headed by a participle, which, from the point of view of the inside of the clause, acts as its verb; but from the outside of the subordinate clause, the participle looks like a noun or a word of another part of speech such as an adjective or an adverb, by taking the role prefix corresponding to that part of speech.
